# ROR sample_two

This folder contains sample code of ruby-on-rails application build v4.2.5.1 of rails. 
The core idea of this application was reading data of fabrics stored in google sheets and updating status in database accordingly.
This application uses postgres database & mailgun gem for mailing.

Added few files from the project, just for reference.
